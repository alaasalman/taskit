TaskIt - A GTD Task List Application
----------------------------------


About
-----
The TaskIt application aims to help you in your Getting things Done(GTD) 
approach and thus provides a task list or a ToDo list. When you organize
your thoughts and put them down in your TaskIt list, you will get a much
better view of your tasks.


Features
--------
The basic features of TaskIt are:
- use categories to organize tasks

Uses the awesome famfamfam icons.


Requirements
------------
For running TaskIt, you will need Python version 2.5.
You also need the Qt framework version 4.3 or similar as well as the corresponding
PyQt bindings. You can also need SQLAlchemy version 4.0.

TaskIt also uses sqlite version 3 as its underlying database. I believe 
that python sqlite bindings are now distributed as part of the vanilla python.

Usage
-----
To run TaskIt just type
$ ./taskit.py
on a console 


Windows
-------
TaskIt also runs under Windows. You just need to make sure that you get
its dependencies. So make sure you have Python and Sqlite and PyQt as
well as SQLAlchemy running on your platform and TaskIt should run just fine.
